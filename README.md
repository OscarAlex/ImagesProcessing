# Images processing

Simple projects using the OpenCV library.\
In the covid.py file, x-ray images of healthy people, with pneumonia and with covid were used to train a neural network and classify new cases.\
In the rock_mod.py file, a neural network was trained with images of different types of rocks to classify them.
